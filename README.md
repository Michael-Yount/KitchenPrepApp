# KitchenPrepApp

This application is designed for culinary staff in a team/kitchen environment. 
It will help connect a team throughout the full spectrum of a day/week in a kitchen atmosphere. It focues on equiping the culinary staff with some important tools
that can help make the job easier and more transparent. 
   Teams can form captains that will delegate the work to those who will get the job done with the most accuraccy and the effectivness.

I would like to test how much cross-career usability can be possible as a productivity tool.
